GREETING ONE ANOTHER
Welcome one another as Christ has welcomed you
greet God each day
Greet one another with the kiss of love. Peace to all of you who are in Christ.
All the brothers send you greetings. Greet one another with a holy kiss.
I give thanks to my God always for you because of the grace of God that was given you in Christ Jesus,
Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss.
Fear not, for I am with you; be not dismayed, for I am your God; I will strengthen you, I will help you, I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.
