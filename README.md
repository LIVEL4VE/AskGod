# About AskGod


AskGod is a GodSpeaks Clone (invented by terry davis, ported onto python by https://github.com/rethyxyz)
 This Program uses RethyXYZ's code and adds user input, greetings, all answered using gods terminology taken straight from the bible. RethyXYZ part of the code is a direct clone of GodSpeaks which main purpose is to send decoded messages from god himself to the user. with AskGod it is possible to have a conversation with god. You ask questions with this bot and it would answer how god would answer. 


# How It Works


This bot uses words from god (using his exact words from the bible) and turns your question into an answer using words that god would use (and have used.) 
The bot uses words that god has used and uses words similar to those he has used. We get new words by using his tone of voice and observing his terminology and vocabulary.
When we get new words we add them via text file which you can download safely using github. We are working to make a feature to get new words and implement them into the program.

# Main

this project was inspired by terry Davis! this also would not be possible without (https://github.com/rethyxyz) I seen his code and he gave me the idea to do all this.

basically, I've added a few new things to it. it's still true to its original purpose and idea with it being a chatbot, but it uses "God's words" to respond to user input. the words which are printed out are randomly generated using his words and for more direct answers, they are rephrased sentences taken from the bible uses quotes from god.
