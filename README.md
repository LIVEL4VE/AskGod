# Update

Currently, development has been slow, but i plan on recoding most of it because i know a way to clean the code up and make it more easier to work with.
when the code  is done i will be putting it up on a websitte where everyone can use for free.



# About AskGod


AskGod is a GodSpeaks Clone (invented by terry davis, ported onto python by https://github.com/rethyxyz)
 This Program uses RethyXYZ's code and adds user input, greetings, all answered using gods terminology taken straight from the bible. RethyXYZ part of the code is a direct clone of GodSpeaks which main purpose is to send decoded messages from god himself to the user. with AskGod it is possible to have a conversation with god. You ask questions with this bot and it would answer how god would answer. 


# How It Works


This bot uses words from god (using his exact words from the bible) and turns your question into an answer using words that god would use (and have used.) 
The bot uses words that god has used and uses words similar to those he has used. We get new words by using his tone of voice and observing his terminology and vocabulary.
When we get new words we add them via text file which you can download safely using github. We are working to make a feature to get new words and implement them into the program.

# Requirements
modules used:
random
os
colorama
time

i am trying as hard as possible to use as less modules as possible but the only one u may need to install is os and colorama.



# Main

this project was inspired by terry Davis! this also would not be possible without (https://github.com/rethyxyz) I seen his code and he gave me the idea to do all this.

basically, I've added a few new things to it. it's still true to its original purpose and idea with it being a chatbot, but it uses "God's words" to respond to user input. the words which are printed out are randomly generated using his words and for more direct answers, they are rephrased sentences taken from the bible uses quotes from god.



# What I've added:

instead of just generating text I've added features such as giving an option to answer questions right off the bat. this is gonna be used for the bot to learn and use for future output. for example, one of the questions is "do you read the bible" it will start a conversation based on the answer given. this is not finished yet but I believe this will be the best part of the code. when I finish it. for now, if no specific questions are asked it just outputs random words made with God's words which I plan to fix later on.

I've also added an anti-slur type thing. if you look into the code there will be slurs and other stuff. I realized that whoever may use this may exploit it such as making the bot say dumb stuff such as when the bot asks a question, and the user could answer it as "some slur" and the bot will output, "I like "some slur" too!" so I've added that but I need a faster way to add a lot of them at once which I will also look into
