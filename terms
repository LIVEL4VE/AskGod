I
say
unto
you,
till

pass,

But
I
say
to
you,
that
whosoever
is
angry
with
his
brother,
shall
be
in
danger
of
the
judgment.
And
whosoever
shall
say
to
his
brother,
Raca,
shall
be
in
danger
of
the
council.
And
whosoever
shall
say,
Thou
fool,
shall
be
Be
at
agreement
with
thy
adversary
betimes,
whilst
thou
art
in
the
way
with
him:
lest
perhaps
the
adversary
deliver
thee
to
the
judge,
and
the
judge
deliver
thee
to
the
officer,
and
thou
be
cast
into
prison.	
Take
heed
that
you
do
not
your
justice
before
men,
to
be
seen
by
them:
otherwise
you
shall
not
have
a
reward
of
your
Father
who
is
in
heaven.	
Therefore
when
thou
dost
an
alms-deed,
sound
not
a
trumpet
before
thee,
as
the
hypocrites
do
in
the
synagogues
and
in
the
streets,
that
they
may
be
honoured
by
men.
Amen
I
say
to
you,
they
have
received
their
reward.	
And
when
you
fast,
be
not
as
the
hypocrites,
sad.
For
they
disfigure
their
faces,
that
they
may
appear
unto
men
to
fast.
Amen
I
say
to
you,
they
have
received
their
reward.	.	
Happy  Birth Dat e
While
I
was
with
them,
I
kept
them
in
thy
name.
Those
whom
thou
gavest
me
have
I
kept:
and
none
of
them
is
lost,
but
the
son
of
perdition:
that
the
scripture
may
be
fulfilled.
